At 27 weeks pregnant, both you and your baby are experiencing significant changes:

* Baby's Development: The baby is about 35 cm long and weighs around 820 grams. The brain and lungs are still developing, and the baby is practicing swallowing amniotic fluid.
* Mother's Changes: You may gain about 500 grams per week and feel more tired. The uterus is now above the belly button, and progesterone is causing the pelvis to soften, which can lead to pelvic pain.
* Interaction with Baby: You can start feeling the baby move by placing your hand on your belly.
* Colostrum Production: From the 26th week, you might notice colostrum, the first breast milk, leaking from your nipples. It's rich in nutrients and antibodies for the baby.",Trimester 2 Ends. Baby can breathe,67.5% - 70.0%

* Weight Differences: Boys weigh 1030-1190 grams, girls 960-1110 grams.

Changes in You:
* Baby's Movements: Feel kicks daily; recognize movement patterns.
* Monitoring Movements: If no movement is felt, rest and try to make contact. If still quiet after an hour, call your midwife/doctor or medical practicioner.
* Pregnancy Line: Dark line from navel due to pigment accumulation, which fades post-pregnancy. Increased pigmentation may also appear on nipples and labia.
