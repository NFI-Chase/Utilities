You're now halfway through your pregnancy! Your baby is about 24 cm long and weighs around 300 grams, moving up to 200 times a day. The 20-week ultrasound may be scheduled or already completed, allowing for a check on development, potential abnormalities, and even revealing the gender—if your baby cooperates.  

*Your Baby's Development
- The umbilical cord pumps 25 liters of blood daily, supplying oxygen and nutrients while removing waste.  
- Growth is steady, with a weight gain of 50-100 grams per week.  
- Your baby practices swallowing amniotic fluid, helping develop the digestive system and producing the first meconium (black, sticky stool).  
- You may now clearly feel kicks from all sides of your belly, unless the placenta is at the front, which may delay sensation.  

*Changes in Your Body  
- Pregnancy feels more familiar now—it's a great time to explore relaxation and birth preparation classes.  
- Leg cramps, especially at night, are common. Magnesium supplements before bed may help.  
- Your blood pressure** may fluctuate, but your midwife will monitor it. Reflexology can also ease pregnancy-related discomforts.

Your baby is now around 27 cm long and weighs 375 grams. While there's still plenty of space in your belly, your baby is getting bigger and will continue to gain weight—almost 10 times more before birth!  

*Your Baby’s Development
- Your baby's senses (hearing, taste, smell, and sight) are developing in different parts of the brain.  
- REM sleep has started, meaning your baby can now dream, which is crucial for brain development.  
- The uterus has grown significantly and now sits just below your navel.  

*Changes in Your Body 
- You might feel short of breath as your diaphragm is pushed up by your growing uterus.  
- Pregnancy hormones increase your breathing rate, making you inhale and exhale more air.  
- Pelvic floor discomfort is common, but exercises can help.  
- You may experience ligament pain—a sharp pain on the sides of your uterus due to rapid growth.  

*Strange Dreams? It’s Normal!
Many expectant mothers have vivid or unsettling dreams about their baby. This is a normal way for your brain to process your fears and prepare you for motherhood.

At 22 weeks, your baby measures about 28.5 cm and weighs 440 grams. Most of the time is spent sleeping, often in a unique fetal position. When you are active, your movements gently rock the baby to sleep, but once you lie down, the baby may wake up due to the lack of motion.  

*Changes in Your Body  
Your lower ribs may feel sore as your growing uterus pushes against them. Sitting upright or raising your arms can help ease discomfort. If you experience joint pain, osteopathy or reflexology might provide relief.  

Since you are pregnant, your period stops, but you may notice increased vaginal discharge. White or light yellow discharge is normal, but if it becomes dark, crumbly, or has a bad odor, consult your midwife or doctor as it could indicate an infection.  

Be cautious when lifting heavy objects, as it can strain your abdomen, pelvis, and back. Your pelvis, in particular, undergoes significant stress during pregnancy.  ",,55.0% - 57.5%

At 23 weeks, your baby is looking more like a fully developed newborn. The head is now more proportionate to the body. In boys, the scrotum is well-formed, while in girls, the ovaries already contain millions of eggs.  

Your baby is also practicing breathing by inhaling and exhaling amniotic fluid, preparing for life outside the womb. Additionally, frequent movements help develop muscles, and the long umbilical cord provides ample space for stretching and kicking.  

Your Body at 23 Weeks Pregnant  
Cravings for unhealthy foods may be strong, but it's essential to monitor your blood pressure. While low blood pressure can cause dizziness, high blood pressure requires moderation in salt intake. Be mindful of foods high in salt, like licorice, soups, sauces, chips, and processed meats.  

Your taste preferences might shift—if you usually prefer sweet foods, you might now crave salty snacks, or vice versa.  

Pregnancy can also make the tiny blood vessels in your nose more fragile, leading to occasional nosebleeds, which are harmless unless they occur too frequently.

Around this time, your baby may start to descend into your pelvis, which is a sign that delivery is getting close.

Your Body: You might feel heavier now. If the baby is sitting high, breathing deeply can be tough because of pressure on your diaphragm and ribcage. Once the baby descends, breathing eases, but you may need to urinate more often as the baby's head presses on your bladder.

Lying on your back might make you feel dizzy or nauseous due to pressure on a large blood vessel. It’s better to lie on your side or use pillows for support.

What’s Happening with You:
- You might feel impatient, especially with friends and family frequently checking in.
- Some women naturally go beyond 40 weeks, possibly due to a larger placenta producing more progesterone, which slows contractions.
- Enjoy these final days—you might miss your baby bump later!
Things to Do This Week:
1. Register Your Baby’s Birth:  
   The legal father (or person who acknowledged the child) must register the birth within three working days at the Civil Registry in the place of birth.
   
2. Prepare for Maternity Care & Feeding:  
   A maternity nurse will assist you with feeding and newborn care in the first week.

3. Learn About the Apgar Score:  
   Right after birth, the midwife will assess your baby’s health using the Apgar score (up to 10 points) to ensure everything is okay.

*Pregnancy at 41 Weeks

It’s completely normal to still be pregnant past your due date. Most babies are born between weeks 37 and 42, and regular check-ups with your midwife continue.

Baby's Experience During Labor
In early labor, your baby may still be sleeping and unaware of contractions. As labor progresses and contractions intensify, your baby becomes more alert and experiences less room to move. The pushing contractions are the most intense for your baby, but a healthy baby can handle this well. During contractions, the baby's heart rate may temporarily slow down due to pressure on the head and reduced blood flow from the placenta.

Your Experience at 41 Weeks
*Inducing Labor:
If labor hasn’t started naturally, your midwife might suggest inducing labor to avoid waiting longer.

*Stripping:
Another method to encourage labor is ""stripping."" During an internal exam, if your cervix is soft and slightly dilated, your midwife can gently separate the membranes around the cervix. This stimulates the release of prostaglandins, often triggering contractions within 20 hours. Stripping may feel uncomfortable but is usually not painful. It can be repeated if necessary.

Practical Tips:
- Child Benefit: After registering your baby with the municipality, you’ll receive child benefit forms. The municipality notifies the Social Insurance Bank (SVB), which handles the benefits.
- Health Insurance: Review your health insurance to ensure it covers your needs. You can adjust your policy until the end of the year.
- Baby’s Sleeping Position: After birth, your baby may naturally sleep in the same position they were in the last days in the womb.

*42 Weeks Pregnant: What to Expect

*Your Baby:
By now, your baby is fully developed and looks much like any full-term newborn—plump, possibly with a head of hair, and the soft down (lanugo) and protective vernix are gone. Their skin might appear a little dry and flaky after birth. Many babies born at 42 weeks have simply enjoyed a bit of extra time in the womb.

*You:  
You might feel impatient or uncomfortable at this stage. If labor hasn’t started naturally by now, you’ll likely be induced soon, usually in a hospital setting.

*Quick Facts & Tips:
- A normal delivery can happen anytime from three weeks before to two weeks after your due date.
- If labor hasn’t started by now, it's considered a post-term pregnancy (serotinity).
- After birth, your belly may feel soft and stretched. Don’t worry—it’s normal, and with healthy eating and regular exercise, your body will gradually return to shape.",Trimester 3 Ends. Full Term,99.1% - 100%
